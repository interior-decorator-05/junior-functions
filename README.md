# ***`Fun`*** ctions
In this project you will be working with functions in javascript.
Functions are blocks of code that can be called upon at any time to perform a specific task. You will need to understand functions, parameters, returns, conditionals in order to complete the problems ahead.

## Set-up && getting started.
1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Open up a new terminal session.
3. `cd` into your project directory. Ex: `~/Documents/junior-functions`
3. Run `nvm use 6.8.0`.
4. Run `npm install`.
5. Run `npm run check` to check your functions. Don't forget to console.log your functions.
6. Run `npm run functions` to check tests.
```javascript
function doesSomething(){
  return true;
}
console.log(doesSomething());
```
7. When finished with each problem, commit and synch your work to github.

## Problems

Your answer should be similar to the output below
Ex: 'Your age is 11 or 12'

#### CHALLENGE 002: PPAP REMIX JS style
Create a function called `ppapRemix` and have it accept 3 parameters: item1, item2, item3. What you will do is replace the original lyrics of the PPAP song with your own Items.   
Ex: tick, tack, toe.    
```
TTTT,   
I have a tick. I have a toe, Uh!, toe-tick,   
I have a tick, I have tack, Uh! tack-tick,    
toe-tick, tack-tick, Uh! tick-tack-toe-tick,  
```  
HINT: You will need to figure out a way to get the first letter of each word you pass in.   
To do this try the {String}.charAt() method that can be found here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/charAt
